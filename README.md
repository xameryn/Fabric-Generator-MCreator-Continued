Yet another fork of Goldorion's MCreator Fabric generator, hoping to get closer to full Forge generator pairity.

# MCreator Fabric Generator - Continued

A plugin for [MCreator](https://mcreator.net/), a code generator to create Minecraft mods. Adds a [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) generator type.

## Important Information
- Make sure you use MCreator 2023.4
- Back up your workspace before updating to a newer version of the plugin.
- Mods will also require [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) to function properly, so when you want to play your mod, make sure you have Fabric API.
